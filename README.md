## Project Structure:

As in Unity projects things get messy easy, lets try to get a clean structure, and every part of the game should be in its correspondant folder. Scripts in script folder, and so on...

The first testing scene (SampleScene) is in the Scenes folder, where we can find a:
* Terrain
* Some examples of free environment
* The player, that has movement
* A companion, that will follow the player

## Git Structure

In the same manner as before, we should try to do one branch per group. I updated this first example in the main branch, but lets create one branch per group, so we can do pull requests before merging all in the main one.

In this way, Procedural content, FSM and animations can be tested without problems between each part.
